We are running a Jabber to IRC transport that enables the use of IRC Channels as Jabber MUCs. Just join our MUCs (Groupchat) with the name *#channel*@irc.hackint.org.

For a good mobile experience configure your XMPP-Server to support [Stream Management](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html) and [Message Archiving](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html).

Read up on how to effectively use the bridge with extended features like persistence and message archiving in the [official documentation](https://biboumi.codeberg.page/doc/user.html).
