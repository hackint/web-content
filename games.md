The Idle RPG is just what it sounds like: an RPG in which the players idle. In addition to merely gaining levels, players can find items and battle other players. However, this is all done for you; you just idle. There are no set classes; you can name your character anything you like, and have its class be anything you like, as well.

Werewolf is a popular party game where social cues and the right mix of guesswork lead to winning. You slip into the role of either the village or the werevoles, who obviously try to kill the other faction, without having exact knowledge about all players roles.
